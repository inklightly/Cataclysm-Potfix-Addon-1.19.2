# Cataclysm-Potfix-Addon-1.19.2
Patches a bug in L_Enders_Cataclysm-2.46-1.19.2, that causes the game to crash when breaking/interacting with a Decorated Pot.

# Important
I am not L_Ender, nor am I affiliated with L_Ender. The original mod can be found here:
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lendercataclysm
L_Enders_Cataclysm-2.46-1.19.2 is a required dependency. Please make sure you have the original mod installed before launching.

I will not be pushing updates or making other versions, this is a bandaid until the original mod's 1.19.2 version gets patched.
