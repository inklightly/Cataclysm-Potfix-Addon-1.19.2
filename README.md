# Cataclysm-Potfix-Addon-1.19.2
Patches a bug in L_Enders_Cataclysm-2.46-1.19.2, that causes the game to crash when breaking/interacting with a Decorated Pot.

## Important
Cataclysm is a minecraft mod created by L_Ender. \
I am not L_Ender, nor am I affiliated with L_Ender. The original mod can be found here: \
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lendercataclysm \
L_Enders_Cataclysm-2.46-1.19.2 is a required dependency. Please make sure you have the original mod installed before launching. \
 \
I will not be pushing updates or coding for other versions, this is a bandaid until the original mod's 1.19.2 version gets patched. \
 \
Created with assistance from GPT-5. I *barely* know java, and this mod isn't open source. Don't @ me.

## Dev Note
If you intend to do your own work on this code, the .jar of the base mod should be placed into the libs folder.
